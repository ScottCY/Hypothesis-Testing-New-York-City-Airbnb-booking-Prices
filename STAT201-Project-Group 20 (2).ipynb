    "Data science is undoubtedly one of the most lucrative career options. However, it's crucial to recognize that salary can vary significantly based on factors like location and company (Situ et al., 2017). Therefore, it's essential to weigh all aspects when choosing job offers (Robinson et al., 2020). Hence, analyzing the difference in salary between different regions could provide employees insights to choose a place to start their journey in data science. Data science salary rankings have reported that North America typically offers higher salaries for data science jobs compared to those in Europe (Ganguli, 2021). So in this case, we would like to investigate this statement through the data we have."

    "\n",
    "1. Independent: Our sample consist of 158 and 388 data from Europe and North America, respectively. By logical thinking, the total number of data science job in Europe and North America should be greater than 1580 and 3880, respectively. Hence, since our two samples are both smaller than 10% of the population, it would be safe to assume independent here.\n",
    "2. Parameter Type: Here as we are dealing with a parameter that is difference in means, which is construct via linear combination of random variables. Hence, we meet the assumption of sum of random variables.\n",
    "3. Sample Size: To use CLT, we need sample size to be large. A common rule of thumb is that the sample size should be larger than 30. Here, our two sample sizes are 158 and 388, which is fairly large to use CLT.\n",
    "\n",
